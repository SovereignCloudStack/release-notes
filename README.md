## Roadmap

We have a 6 month release cadence -- R5 will follow in September 2023.
Until then, we will provide bugfixes and security fixes for R4.

We do work towards a model where our partners can actually follow our main
development branches -- right now, our CI needs a bit more coverage though
to make this safe.
