# Release Notes for SCS Release 1
(Release Date: 2021-09-29)

## Scope

Main goals for Release 1 (R1) was the strengthening of our CI test coverage and
integration, the operational tooling (metrics collection, dashboards, logging),
latest versions of upstream software (OpenStack Wallaby, Kubernetes-1.21.5),
support for Bare Metal service, progress on user federation for clouds, and
progress on the integration of the container layer with k8s Cluster API (now in
version 0.4.x).


## CI framework

### Zuul-CI

For our internal development workflows we are planning to switch from GitHub
Actions to Zuul-CI (mostly). The infrastructure itself is already available,
yet most of the repositories in the SovereignCloudStack organisation have not
switched over. Reasons for switching include cross-dependencies, scalability
and costs. Reasons for using Zuul-CI include the close connection to the
OpenStack project and the enormous flexibility in comparison to other similar
tools. On top of that you have also gating instead of only CI. A quick example
for a Zuul-CI operated repository can be found here:
https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/zuul-sandbox.

## Metrics collection and dashboards

### Prometheus exporters and Grafana dashboards

We provide generic configuration examples and blueprints for prometheus rules
and grafana dashboards. The examples need to be understood and adapted to the
particular needs of your environment. You can find the examples at
<https://github.com/osism/kolla-operations>.

With R2 we plan to implement a basic set of these alerts and dashboards in the
testbed deployment in order to make them even easier consumable for new users.
Feel free to give feedback on the examples and contribute your own generic
examples.

We're working on bringing a basic set of prometheus exporters to the
OpenStack-kolla upstream community.

As part of our effort to add more monitoring tooling, we're integrating further
prometheus exporters such as
[libvirt](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla-ansible/+/643568) and
[ovn](https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla/+/762986). Integration is
targeted for R2.

More detailed information on monitoring topics will be continously provided in
the [corresponding design
document](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs/blob/main/https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main/Design-Docs/monitoring.md).

### openstack-health-monitor

We have made some progress with openstack-health-monitor since R0, but we have
not yet created ready-to-be-used influx data collection and the grafana
dashboard.  While the black box monitoring is perceived as very useful, the
script certainly has reached a complexity that is not handled well with bash
scripting and makes it a difficult to maintain and even to use tool, so the
usefulness of shipping it with SCS to make it available for Ops teams to
monitor has been questioned. Instead an expectation has been expressed that the
SCS uses this to monitor all SCS partner clouds and provides some transparency
this way to the public -- and detailed statistics via e.g. a prometheus
exporter to the respective cloud provider. This is currently under consideration.

## Logging

### Central logging

OSISM now enables kolla-ansible centralized logging by default. The default
rules need to be further refined to suit your needs. We plan to implement a
more generic set of rules for R2.

## Federation

### OIDC support via keycloak

Logging in to Horizon by authenticating with OIDC via Keycloak is now possible.
For details see the [testbed documentation](
https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/8430afdd36307acc1bf5ebd930ecbd3dd4b1dd22/docs/source/usage.rst#authentication-with-openid-connect).

### non-TLS restrictions (testbed)

Only TLS secured deployments get full support.
Without TLS, certain browsers won't be able to log in.
For deatils see the [testbed documentation](
https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/8430afdd36307acc1bf5ebd930ecbd3dd4b1dd22/docs/source/usage.rst#ssl-tls-connection-to-keycloak-openid-connect-provider)

### Known Issue with OIDC Logout

Clicking `Sign Out` on the Horizon dashboard doesn't perform
a proper OIDC logout. This is documented in [osism testbed](
https://github.com/osism/testbed/blob/8430afdd36307acc1bf5ebd930ecbd3dd4b1dd22/docs/source/usage.rst#openstack-web-dashboard-horizon-logout),
with some Keycloak settings that can be relevant for alleviating the issue,
but in Release 1 there is no solution for this yet.


## Bare Metal Service

The ironic Bare Metal service can be deployed with the SCS (OSISM)
installation. For it to get full test coverage, a virtual BMC
solution has been created, so bare metal can be validated in our testbed
setup just as nicely as the other components. While most pieces
are ready, the final integration steps are still work-in-progress
and will happen after R1.

## Container Layer 

### Overview and Goals for R1

The container layer on SCS is implemented as a Self-Service,
leveraging the [Kubernetes cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
technology. This was provided as a technical preview from the
[SCS k8s-cluster-api-provider](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider)
repository for R0 back in July.

The focus for R1 was to make it ready for production, so DevOps teams can
use this to create and manage their k8s clusters in self-service for
development, testing, deployment and production.

To achieve this, a lot of work has been invested, updating the
cluster API to 0.4 along the way, fixing snapshot classes, enabling
optional metrics and ingress services, using application credentials
and much improved management scripts. The sonobuoy test automation has
been included and successfully used to validate the created clusters.
Real-world testing has happened though the Gaia-X Hackathon #1, where
clusters were provided on the fly for the various work streams.

The detailed list of changes for R1 is covered in the
[k8s capi provider Release Notes](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/k8s-cluster-api-provider/blob/master/Release-Notes-R1.md).

Still in technical preview, but very promising are the helm charts
based k8s cluster management templates also documented there.

### Beyond CAPI

Some of our partners are using [Gardener](https://gardener.io) as a layer to manage
large fleets of (optionally cross-cloud) k8s clusters. While there is a bit of
overlap in functionality, they do happily coexist and our partner is actually
using k8s capi to bootstrap clusters on SCS clouds for Gardener management.

## Standardization

As of this writing, the list of SCS defined standards still comprises
two standards:

* [SCS Flavor naming and standard flavors standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main/Design-Docs/flavor-naming.md)

* [SCS Image naming and metadata standard](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main/Design-Docs/Image-Properties-Spec.md)

As before, we continue to rely on OpenStack and CNCF defined standards
in addition to this -- the k8s clusters need to pass the conformance
tests with sonobuoy and the OpenStack environment the OpenStack powered
guidelines (with refstack).

There is a discussion on a glossary, detailing what we expect from regions,
availability zones etc. Some major parts of it still need to be agreed
before a useful doc can be published -- this will happen in due time and
is expected before R2.

## SBOM and Links

We stand on the shoulders of giants:
Without all the great work from many open source communities, we would
not get anywhere.

We are working on automation to create a complete list for all the software
that is used and deployed with SCS, so we have a complete Software Bill
of Materials (SBoM). The reason this is non-trivial is that we are not
aggregating it all ourselves, but rely on pre-integrated pieces, such
as Linux distributions, OpenStack, CNCF projects etc. The good news is
that these projects are diligent in their work, making sure we don't need
to be too worried about security risks or legal risks introduced this way.
Nevertheless, the goal of creating a complete graph remains.

We have started to put SPDX license identifiers into the SCS produced
code, so we make it easier for downstream consumers of our software to
automate the license compliance checks when assembling an SBoM.

For R1, some of the major projects we build on have had releases that we
incorporated and whose release notes we want to link here for convenience:

* [Kubernetes v1.21.x](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases)
* [Kubernetes Cluster API v0.4](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases)
  and [k8s cluster-api-provider openstack v0.4](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/releases)
* [OpenStack Wallaby](https://releases.openstack.org/wallaby/) [Release Highlights](https://releases.openstack.org/wallaby/highlights.html)

## Release tagging

See [Release Numbering scheme](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/standards/tree/main/Design-Docs/Release-Numbering-Scheme.md) -- unchanged from R0.
We have added the tag `v2.0.0` to the relevant repositories to designate the `SCS_RELEASE_R1`.

## List of known issues & restrictions in R1

* [OIDC Logout doesn't work properly](#Known-Issue-with-OIDC-Logout).

* OIDC Login is meant to be used with TLS, on
[non-TLS setups it only works with restrictions](#non-TLS-restrictions-testbed).
